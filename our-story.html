                <h2>The Beginning - 2020</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>We launched <strong>ANAR - Your Online Tutor</strong> to give students flexible academic support. Need help with just one math chapter? Take a single class. Confused about a science concept? Get clarity on that topic only.</p>
                <p>Students could choose which subject, which topic, how many classes they needed. Pay only for what they actually used.</p>
                <p>It worked. We helped <strong style="color: var(--coral);">thousands of students</strong> fill their specific knowledge gaps. Parents loved the flexibility. Students got exactly the help they needed.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600; color: var(--coral); margin-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">But we kept noticing something.</p>

                <h2>The Pattern We Couldn't Ignore</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>The students who struggled most weren't struggling with math formulas or science concepts. They were struggling with basic literacy. Reading the questions. Understanding what was being asked.</p>
                <p>In school classrooms with 30+ students, even the best teachers couldn't give individual attention to every child who was falling behind in reading. Some kids just got left behind.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600; color: var(--cyan); margin-top: 2rem;">We realized something important: once a child masters basic literacy, they can find solutions for their academic growth on their own. But without that foundation, everything else becomes a struggle.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>We understood that literacy is the foundation of all learning. If we could get this right, really right, everything else would follow.</p>
                <p>But foundations matter too much to get wrong. We wanted to create something authentic and as close to perfect as we could make it.</p>
                <p>That's when we decided to bring AI into the picture. Not as a replacement for human teaching, but as a way to give every child the individual attention they deserved. AI could adapt to each child's pace, provide endless patience, and never let anyone fall behind.</p>

                <p>By 2022, we officially became <strong>AptYou Services Pvt Ltd</strong> with a clearer mission: build the foundational skills that make all other learning possible.</p>
                <p><strong>AptyRead</strong> emerged from watching young students struggle with reading. If children could develop strong literacy skills early, with proper support and at their own pace, everything else would follow.</p>
                <p>Each product was born from real challenges we witnessed in real learners.</p>

                <h2>What We've Learned</h2>

            <div class="about-content" style="text-align: left; max-width: 800px;">
                <p><strong>Learning is deeply personal.</strong> Every child learns at their own pace. In a classroom of many, some children need more time and individual attention than a teacher can provide.</p>
                <p><strong>But once a child becomes confident in reading and writing, they become independent learners.</strong> They can tackle academic challenges on their own because they have the tools they need.</p>
                <p><strong>Technology can help, but only when it serves the learner.</strong> AI can provide the individual attention and endless patience that busy classrooms sometimes can't. But it can't replace the human connection and encouragement that every child needs.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; color: var(--coral); margin-top: 2rem;">Most importantly: get the foundation right, and everything else becomes possible.</p>

            <div class="about-content">
                <p>We're expanding AptyRead to more languages because every child deserves strong literacy skills, regardless of their first language. Hindi, Malayalam, Arabic, and more are coming soon.</p>
                <p>We're continuing ANAR because sometimes you just need a good teacher to help you understand. Real teachers, real help—that will always matter.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">We're partnering with educators, institutions, and parents who share our belief: get the foundation right, and everything else becomes possible.</p>
